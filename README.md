## Installation

Axelrod-evolver relies on the axelrod library. Install it with

```
pip install axelrod 
```

or build from source using [http://axelrod.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorials/getting_started/getting_started.html#installation](instructions here). 

Axelrod seems to have some dependencies that don't get installed automatically; you can install them plus `docopt` which is required by the evolver script by running

```
pip install docopt numpy cloudpickle
```

Once you have the dependencies, clone this git repository.

## Running

`python lookup-evolve.py -h`

will display help.
